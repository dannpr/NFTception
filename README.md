# Solar NFT

Are you a player that likes arts ? A NFT collectors ? Our games is there for you ! Welcome to NFT'ception !! 


Solar NFT is a way for users to plan value on ETH space. Each Planeth in the game can store up to 5 NFTs. The core idea was to build an infrastructure which allows users to discover subjectively valuable NFTs, to display their NFT holdings and to incentivize users to create high utility content.
Users are incentivized to battle each other to reach the center of the gameverse. Battles consist in two players putting their NFTs up for value comparisons within the community. Players can fulfil daily missions where they are given pairs of NFTs to compare in between. Those that vote for the NFT which is also recognized by the community as most valuable receive an ERC-20 game token incentive, while those that win battles can choose in between: switching Planeth spots with the loser, receiving tokens, or expanding their limited Planeth’s NFT slots. Players that decline to battle or those whose NFTs were aggregately considered by the community as of less subjective value than their opponent’s do not lose anything (unless they agree to battling with the outcome of switching spots*). 
As value is subjective to the individual, repeatedly measuring the value the community attributes and aggregating it should help move towards somewhat of an objective utility measurement for the group. We hypothesize that by setting up game incentives for players to measure value, users would end up producing more utility in their NFTs.
Repeated subjective appraisals can help find value in between heterogenous goods. Setting up economic and reputation incentives for users to compare in between their NFTs ought to increase the odds of users producing high quality goods.
